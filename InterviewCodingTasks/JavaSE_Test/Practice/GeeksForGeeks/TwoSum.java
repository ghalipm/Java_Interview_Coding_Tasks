 * Problem Statement:
 * Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to
 * a specific target number.
 * The method twoSum(int[] input, target)should return indices of the
 * two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be
 * less than index2. Please note that your returned answers
 * (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
 *
 * Note: You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 *
 * Example
 * [12,17,21,25], 29 -> [1,2]
